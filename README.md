# Random

This is a Random Number generator written in RAPID, that allows the user to create random integers, floats, uniform (0-1), or gausians (distributed about the mean, with a standard deviation). 

it includes: 

Random_v1.3.sys                     - the raw Hidden System Module that contains the random number generator (in case you prefer to load it manually). 


SYS.cfg                             - the System Configuration that allows Random_v1.3.sys to be automatically loaded in all tasks


Install.cmd                         - the Installation Commmand Script used in the Add-In packaging tool to install the add-in


Random.pdf                          - the Description of the add-in, examples of how to use it, & proper syntax


open.abb.random_1.03.0006.00.rmf    - the 'Robot Manifest File' used to import the Add-in into RobotStudio


open.abb.random_1.03.0006.00.rpk    - the 'Robot Package' File that is used by Production Manager 6 to add this to your system.
